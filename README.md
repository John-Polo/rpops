<img src= "www/PoPS_Logo.png" width ="25%">

An R wrapper using RCPP for the [PoPS C++ library](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/PoPShttps://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/PoPS). PoPs is a stochastic spread model of pests and pathogens in forest and agricultural landscapes. It has been generalized and new features added but was originally developed for *Phytophthora ramorum* and the original version of the model was based on this reference paper: Ross K. Meentemeyer, Nik J. Cunniffe, Alex R. Cook, Joao A. N. Filipe, Richard D. Hunter, David M. Rizzo, and Christopher A. Gilligan 2011.
